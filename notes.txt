I am close to completing the demo.

The next things to do:
    done -- 1. Add correct background
    done -- 2. Remove gap under photos -- from "td a" tag
    3. Create gallery (including adjustments to close button div)
        to do: figure out why lightbox is openning automatically;
        i might consider starting from scratch using a combination
        of vscode and chatgpt. should be a lot quicker.
        
        the plan: call existing code into a div, use js to create lightbox
        without modifying existing code. 
    
    4. for mobile create a section where you can scroll through the thumbnails
    5. all written portions should be on top
